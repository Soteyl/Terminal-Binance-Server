Every project has similar directory structure.
*Project -> BusinessFeature -> TypeOfEntity*.

In **ExchangeTokens** folder we have **Interfaces** and **Models** folder. 
In **Models** we have **Contracts**, **Data**, **Mapping**, **Repository**, **Service**.
Every folder contains models only for specific requirement.
